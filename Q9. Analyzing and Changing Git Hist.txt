Q9. Analyzing and Changing Git History
Given a commit ID, how would you use Git to view the details of that specific commit, including the author, date, and commit message?


To view the details of a specific commit, including the author, date, and commit message, you can use the following Git command:

git show <commit-id>
Replace <commit-id> with the actual commit hash or commit reference of the commit you want to inspect.

For example:

git show abc123
This command will display detailed information about the specified commit, including the author, date, commit message, and the changes introduced by that commit.

If you only want a more concise summary of the commit information (without the changes), you can use:

git log -n 1 --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s" <commit-id>
This command displays a one-line summary of the commit, showing the abbreviated commit hash (%h), author name (%an), relative author date (%ar), and commit message (%s).

Remember to replace <commit-id> with the actual commit hash or reference you want to inspect.
