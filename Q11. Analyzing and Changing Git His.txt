Q11. Analyzing and Changing Git History
Write the command to display the last five commits in the repository’s history.

To display the last five commits in the repository’s history, you can use the following git log command with the -n option:

git log -n 5
This command shows the latest five commits in the repository, with the most recent commit displayed at the top. Adjust the number after the -n option if you want to see a different number of commits.

If you want a more concise output, you can use the --oneline option:

git log -n 5 --oneline
This provides a one-line summary for each commit, including the abbreviated commit hash and the commit message.
