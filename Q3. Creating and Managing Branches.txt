Q3. Creating and Managing Branches
Write the commands to stash your changes, switch branches, and then apply the stashed changes.

1. Stash your changes:

git stash save "Your stash message"
This command will save your local changes in a temporary area, allowing you to switch branches without committing the changes.

2. Switch to another branch:

git checkout your-desired-branch
3. Apply the stashed changes:

git stash apply
If you have multiple stashes and want to apply a specific stash, you can use:

git stash apply stash@{1}
After applying the stash, your changes are reapplied to the working directory.

4. Remove the applied stash (optional):

If you no longer need the stash after applying it, you can remove it:

git stash drop
To remove a specific stash:

git stash drop stash@{1}
If you want to apply and drop in one step, you can use git stash pop:

git stash pop
Now, youâ€™ve successfully stashed your changes, switched branches, and applied the stashed changes.
